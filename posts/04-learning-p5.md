<h1 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Summery</h1>

Today we went through a p5 doc with **TONS** of information:
[p5 resources](https://editor.p5js.org/POP161516/sketches/avsd5Y1ui)

I had a leg up because I went though the resources last class but the later sketchs about noise and other stuff were new to me and **very** complex😵‍💫

Then we had some fun time to talk about kindred spirits...

<h1 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Class Work</h1>

Since I already mostly knew how each concept worked I didn't save each sketch :/ 

Although in the next task we were asked to propose a potencial p5 sketch we could offer a fictional pair of kindred spirits. For this task I did produce a sketch. 

My group dicided to brainstorm a sketch for marlin adn dory. Since we were writting from marlin's perspective we decided the sketch should include somthing dory likes, this being a purple shell. To create cutness in interactivity and audio we descided the shell should be dragable and create water sounds when's velocity increases.

This was my mock up(without the sound aspect yet🤫):

<h3 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Kindred Spirits</h3>

First I've gotta consider what kindred spirit I'm offering my assignment 1 too🤔🤔🤔

A few ideas I've been throwing up were:
- My pinapple plant
- My family dog
- The concept of film
- My bike

<h4 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Context of kinship:</h4>

- Pinapple:
    - Twice a week I water it and in return in the summer it sprouts a fruit for me to eat. A symbiotic bond
    - Common purpose: survive?

- Dog:
    - I love my dog, Whenever I'm at my parents house I spend plenty of time with them and take them for walks. 
    - Common purpose: exersize and show love/affection

- Film:
    - I love movies, I watch a moive almost every day and have for the past 6ish years. although I don't feel like the concept of film loves me back. If I enjoyed making film and wasn't disapointed by so many movies maybe I'd be convinced we are kindred spirits. But for now... No
    - Common purpose: spread knowledge?

- Bike:
    - I use my bike almost every day. I love riding as a mode of transport, its free, eco friendly, and fast💨 I think I serve my bike by using it and my bike serves me by transporting me. 
    - Common purpose: exersize, transport.

For now I think I will go with the **bike** 🚲😄

My idea is a game where you can click certain points on the bike to service and clean them up. This way I can incporperate cute interactions and aesthetics in the style of a beuty sim game🤷

To create cute visual aesthetic I'll colour the canvas in typicaly 'cute' or relaxing tones e.g. pink and blue. A common trope in this sort of genre of game.

To create cute interation I will have conponents of the bike react to mouse presses. I'd also like to inclue some congratulatory partical effects.

For sound I will manufacture high pitched and light sound bites of things like bells dinging or wheels spinning.

For homework we had to look at the p5 sketch *'falling falling'*:

<iframe id="falling_falling2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/POP161516/full/VYo6SY3s7"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`falling_falling2`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42

</script>

The first part of this task was to duplicate the origional code then annotate all the parts I understood and didn't. 

Completely honestly I didn't have time to do it this week. I did this task as of the 18th which ment I got to listen to the lecture on classes and function which was **very** helpful, that being said I still missed a **lot**.

<h4 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Things I learnt from searching the p5 resources:</h4>

- Push()
    - My understanding is that its a way of saving or publishing changhes to an array
- Reverse()
    - A way of reversing the order of an array
- LerpColor
    - How you can achive a gradient
- Random()
    - I didn't realise by defult it was a value between 0 adn 1
- Splice
    - Adds entrys into an array
- Floor
    - Rounds a float into an intager

<h4 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Things I still don't get:</h4>

- Lots of geometry stuff
    - .curves
    - vertex
    - phase
    - map()
    - beginShape & endShape

- forEach
- .assign ({}, ?)
- => 

Although, over all I'm happy with how much I got🙃

I think since I've googled each term and used the p5 resources I might ask Thomas next class for some help with these concepts.🤷
