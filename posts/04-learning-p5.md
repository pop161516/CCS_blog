Today we went through a p5 doc with **TONS** of information:
[p5 resources](https://editor.p5js.org/POP161516/sketches/avsd5Y1ui)

I had a leg up because I went though the resources last class but the later sketchs about noise and other stuff were new to me and **very** complex😵‍💫

Then we had some fun time to talk about kindred spirits...

<h1 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Class Work</h1>

Since I already mostly knew how each concept worked I didn't save each sketch :/ 

Although in the next task we were asked to propose a potencial p5 sketch we could offer a fictional pair of kindred spirits. For this task I did produce a sketch. 

My group dicided to brainstorm a sketch for marlin adn dory. Since we were writting from marlin's perspective we decided the sketch should include somthing dory likes, this being a purple shell. To create cutness in interactivity and audio we descided the shell should be dragable and create water sounds when's velocity increases.

This was my mock up(without the sound aspect yet🤫):
