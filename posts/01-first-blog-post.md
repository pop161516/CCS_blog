# Summery
This morning we had a class packed with learning about p5, to my undertanding p5 is a web vertion of JavaScript... "a free and open-source JavaScript library". I've not used JS before, in fact I've not coded before which is a little frightening but I get the feeling there are poeple in my class that will be able to help me ü´£

Then after the break we got into setting up our blogs and git accounts and deno deplot and whatever. I'd done this before in DMS1 but I didn;t manage to get the local set up working. I'll figure that out later though. 

# Class work
### Things I lernt in class:
- JS dosn't care about ";" or spaces which is conviniant but highlights the importance of getting into the habit of writting clean code.
- I learnt syntax:
    - ' ' are used for strings (text)
    - strings are coloured teal
    - variables are blue
    - keywords are yellow
    - and numbers are pink
    - comments are grey
- I learnt commands like
    - ‚åò + / comments out text
    - /* ... */ comments out large chunks
    - ‚åò + return plays the scene
    - ‚åò + return + shift stops the scene
- I learnt about the layered nature of JS and how it reads though line by line and paints a picture each frame.
- I learnt about the help tab and the resources available to leanr how to make shapes like squareds and ajust their propoties like location, size, colour, and stroke.
- I leanr about frsameCounts and making mini animations. I sort of checked out a bit when Thomas was explaining modulo but I'll understand another day ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Then at the end when we are creating th eblogs I learnt about terminal navigation. I'll leave my notes he for future Mataso ü´°
    - ls = list
    - pwd = print working directory
    - cd ~ = chnage directory
    - cd.. +go back (I found that just cd worked for me)
    - open. = open in finder (didnt work for me)

This is sort of cheating becuase I just took it from the template(rather than properly iframing it in) but this is essecialy what we made in class today. 

<canvas id="canvas_example"></canvas>

<script type="module">
    const cnv = document.getElementById (`canvas_example`)
    cnv.width = cnv.parentNode.scrollWidth
    cnv.height = cnv.width * 9 / 16

    const ctx = cnv.getContext (`2d`)
    const pos = {
        x: -100,
        y: cnv.height / 2 - 50
    }
    
    function draw_frame () {
        ctx.fillStyle = `turquoise`
        ctx.fillRect (0, 0, cnv.width, cnv.height)

        ctx.fillStyle = `hotpink`
        ctx.fillRect (pos.x, pos.y, 100, 100)

        pos.x += 2

        if (pos.x > cnv.width) {
            pos.x = -100
        }

        requestAnimationFrame (draw_frame)
    }

    draw_frame ()
</script>

# Homework
### Loops
Ok, for homework I began looking into for loops. These are ways of repeating code in a clean and minimal way. I started by looking at the example provided

I understood most of the code but being compleetly honest I asked ChatGPT so explain what each line did before I felt confident in what was going on.

First test I was mucking around with the square (x, y, s) propoties. I thought that maybe if I ajusted the y then the line may become a grid by duplucateng on each layer.

**Result:**

When this didn't work I got help from p5üôè I went to the "for" page of the resources and red about how the perametres work...

Reading the resources helped a lot, I realised I needed to put the loop in a loop to copy the code along the y axis

**Result:**
![final image](/Images/w1/learningp5grid.png)

I think this is mission complete but I tried to get a bit of padding between each square which proved much harder than anticipated. maybe a task for next timeü´°

### Rafa√´l Rozendaal
Next homework task was to reseach this Rozendaal person and think about how they make their art. the pieces I was most interested in were "passage", "corners", and "pages". 

![image of passage](/Images/w1/refaelpassage.png)

I hypothosise the piece "passage" uses some method of creating rectangles in the centre of the screen then increasing there scale based on the frameCount. I'm not sure how the colour is randomised or how the Trapezoid shape is achived, maybe the squares are rotated or triangles are being used?

(hindsight mataso here, I'm not sure if the piece is scaling from the centre or moving away? and for the trapozoid shape, after looking at the artwork corners I theories a right angle triangle is generated next to the square in the same colourü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

### Fun tasks
The extra tasks were to bring in a selfie + two tuths and a lie for a fun introduction class on thursday.

**Selfie:** 
(selfie image)

Truths and lie:
- I watched each oscar nominated film, a week before the accadamy awards this year.
- I have 16 first cousins
- I'm caught up with one piece 

Then email Thomas with preferd name and pronouns: 
Mataso He/Him.
