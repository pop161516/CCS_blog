# Summery
This class seemed very short, we just went though a breif history of creative coding + the significant figures and the mycelial creative structure. Then we worked on homework and blog stuff.

# Homework
### Asking peers questions:
**Questions to ask:**
1. what do you think is going on, under the hood?
2. what concepts would I need to understand in order to replicate this work in p5?
3. what resources might help me to learn those concepts?

**Lam:**
1. There could be various squares scaleing from the centre that overlap. They don't seem to redraw thre background each frameü§î
2. you might need to learn how to make the cut off square shape. Like a triangle like a trapazoid. You might also need to learn how to line up/connect each shape.
3. W3schools and p5 resources page.

... I didn't get any other responces but I'll work on itüëÄ

### JavaScript homework
The next part of the homework was to imporve at JavaScript... 
I looked briefly at the resources provided: and went through the 
- comments
- print and log
- frameCount & noLoop
- template literals

**Notes:**
- Try to use console.log rather than print becuase it will appempt to print the page to a printer if outside of the set up scope.
- Useing backticks rathas aposed to quotations means you can concole.log ${...} expretions.
- haveing one "=" triggers an assignment 

This was a quick sketch I whipped up to demonstrate an understanding of each topic:
