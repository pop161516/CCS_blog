<h1 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Summery</h1>

This class seemed very short, we just went though a breif history of creative coding + the significant figures and the mycelial creative structure. Then we worked on homework and blog stuff.

<h1 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Homework</h1>

<h3 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Asking peers questions:</h3>

**Questions to ask:**
1. what do you think is going on, under the hood?
2. what concepts would I need to understand in order to replicate this work in p5?
3. what resources might help me to learn those concepts?

**Lam:**
1. There could be various squares scaleing from the centre that overlap. They don't seem to redraw thre background each frameü§î
2. you might need to learn how to make the cut off square shape. Like a triangle like a trapazoid. You might also need to learn how to line up/connect each shape.
3. W3schools and p5 resources page.

... I didn't get any other responces but I'll work on itüëÄ

<h3 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">JavaScript homework</h3>

The next part of the homework was to imporve at JavaScript... 
I looked briefly at the resources provided: and went through the 
- comments
- print and log
- frameCount & noLoop
- template literals

<h4 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Notes:</h4>

- Try to use console.log rather than print becuase it will appempt to print the page to a printer if outside of the set up scope.
- Useing backticks rathas aposed to quotations means you can concole.log ${...} expretions.
- haveing one "=" triggers an assignment 

This was a quick sketch I whipped up to demonstrate an understanding of each topic:

<h4 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Code:</h4>

``` function setup() {
    //frameRate is reduced to make the numbers count up slower
    //increasing this will increase the difficulty
    frameRate(3);
    createCanvas(500, 200);
    background(200);
    noStroke();
    Num = 0;
    }

function draw() {
  background(200);

  //makign sure the text is styled right
  textAlign(CENTER);
  textSize(25);
  fill("black");

  //game text
  text(`Click to reduce the number!!`, 250, 75);
  text(`${frameCount + Num}`, 250, 125);

  //printing the effective value of clicks
  console.log(` ${Num} `);

  //easter egg
  if (Num < -1000) {
    textSize(10);
    text(`wow... you've been clicking for a while :/`, 250, 190);
  }

  //ending the game
  if (Num + frameCount < 0) {
    noLoop();
    background(200);
    text(`You win!`, 250, 100);
    console.log(`Good Game!`);
  }
}

// function creating mouse click interactivity
function mousePressed() {
  Num -= 1;
}`
