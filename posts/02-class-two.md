# Summery
This class seemed very short, we just went though a breif history of creative coding + the significant figures and the mycelial creative structure. Then we worked on homework and blog stuff.

# Homework
### Asking peers questions:
**Questions to ask:**
1. what do you think is going on, under the hood?
2. what concepts would I need to understand in order to replicate this work in p5?
3. what resources might help me to learn those concepts?

**Lam:**
1. There could be various squares scaleing from the centre that overlap. They don't seem to redraw thre background each frameü§î
2. you might need to learn how to make the cut off square shape. Like a triangle like a trapazoid. You might also need to learn how to line up/connect each shape.
3. W3schools and p5 resources page.
