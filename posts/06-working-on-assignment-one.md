In today's lecture, we went through different coding styles. 

Then we ran through last week's homework üìöüôè (explaining how falling falling works)

<h1 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Class Work</h1>

We didn't do too much in class this class. Mainly because most people were working on their assignments. We just commented through "falling falling" and learnt to separate the class into a new file.

I was doing a lot of work on my assignment at this point. I'll include a snippet of the process here but rather than splitting it into different posts I'll publish an "assignment one" post with all the process soonüîú

([Assignment one post(not active)](https://editor.p5js.org/POP161516/sketches/avsd5Y1ui))

<h1 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Homework</h1>

1) Explain how I will use:
    **Variables** - very easily, in fact it would be way more challenging to create an interactive piece with no variables. An example of one I might use could be to store the value of my bikes position so I can rotate it without using orbitControle.

    Functions - by default I'll use setup and draw but I might use a function to make some interactivity with the mousepress() or mousedragged()for bike movement

    Iteration - I might use a loop like a for loop to make a grid of colours in a colour pallet without having to draw each squareü§∑

    Boolean logic - I could store the state of the UI e.g. uiIsOpen === true and uiIsOpen === false. 

    Arrays - I may may need to store position or colour vales in my colour pallet squares which can be stored through an array. [listing, the, colours]

    Classes - Again with my colour pallet I'll need to simplify it and make a cookie cutter so that I don't have to re-write the mouse register position and 'clicked' and active colour code.

2) Embed a rough draft

In this version, I managed to figure out the UI movement and the bike model movement ‚â† orbitControle.

I'm still missing **A LOT** of the ideas and required components but we'll get thereüí™ü§ì

In terms of visual cuteness, I think the pink is doing the heavy lifting. With the UI movement I managed to make it fluid rather than flat which I think adds cuteness of the interaction. Sonically, Nutt'inüòê... yet

What communities and resources did you learn from?

A combination of ([p5.js resources](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/rotateX/)) and Coding train videos ([18.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TPVoB4uQCU )), ([18.5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW3D9WwalQE)) helped me loadmodels and create my own 3d movement without orbit control.

It was important to make a non-orbitControl approach because the UI elements needed to be static. Here is an earlier mock of my sketch:
