This class we started off with a deeper dive into some more advanced topics like functions, classes and objects.

Then after the break we dove into an **even deeper** dive into sound and mouse interaction



<h1 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Class Work</h1>

Takeaways from presentations:
- Dispite reading top down for proccessing, for functions it does somthing called function hoisting where it reads though once to check for function then runs the code. this means global functions can be called before declared. 
- I learnt objects have data(attribute) and behaviours(methods)
- I learnt a little bit about sin waves and vectors. I knew vectors were points with "direction and magnitude" but I learnt that sin was a variable that updates, ocilating between -1 and 1.
