This class we started off with a deeper dive into some more advanced topics like functions, classes and objects.

Then after the break we dove into an **even deeper** dive into sound and mouse interaction


<h1 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Class Work</h1>

Takeaways from presentations:
- Dispite reading top down for proccessing, for functions it does somthing called function hoisting where it reads though once to check for function then runs the code. this means global functions can be called before declared. 
- I learnt objects have data(attribute) and behaviours(methods)
- I learnt a little bit about sin waves and vectors. I knew vectors were points with "direction and magnitude" but I learnt that sin was a variable that updates, ocilating between -1 and 1.

- An arrow => means your dealing with a "function definintion" also called anonymous function or lamda?

1) Choose another Rafael Rozendaal sketch to consider

I'll pick <a href="https://www.newrafael.com/stretch/" target="_blank">stretch</a>

How is it cute...? I dont think I'd say most of their stuff is cute but if I was being lenient..

The viuals are cute becuase it uses bright and pop'ing colours.

Sonicly there is no sound :/

and interactivly its cute becuase each click creates new simulation 

2) How will I create cute🤔

**Visually** I want the canvas to be highly styalised. 

Taking inspiration from other fashion and make-up sim games. I think theres somthing cute about customising your own vertion of something. Maybe nostalgic maybe its about concrole and ownership or an expression of individualism and style 🤷

**Sonically** I want to use bell sounds from my bike in a high-pitched and plesant register. I think the satisfying whrrr of a wheel might also make for a cute sound. 

**Interactivlly** Ideally I want the bike to be 3D and interactive. This would mean being able to spin it around to see all angles and clicking on spicific components to make the bells and whistles ring 🛎️ 🔔

3) feedback from classmates:
:3 I haven't started yet but I'll make sure to get feedback soon 🔜
