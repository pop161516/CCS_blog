# Summery of CCS assignment one (p5.js components)

## Creating models
First step, make your assets!
I innicialy didn't want to source any assets from other libraries but I ran out of time at the end and had to use ([freesound.org](https://freesound.org/)) for some sound effects. 

Really quickly I whipped up a model. I wanted to stay low polly hopfully achiving the nostalgic and cute register.

*Innicialy I exported it with material files link but fixed that up later. 

As you can see, in the blender viewport there was no conections between the frames back legs but there was some sort of error when I viewed it in p5 and on my desktop. I didn't bother fixing this up, I though aslong as the normals pointed in the right direction textureing would function fine and it sort of looks intentional üßê
