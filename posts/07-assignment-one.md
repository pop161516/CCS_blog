<h1 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Summery of CCS assignment one (p5.js components)</h1>

<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Creating models</h2>

First step, make your assets!
I innicialy didn't want to source any assets from other libraries but I ran out of time at the end and had to use <a href="https://freesound.org/" target="_blank">freesound.org</a> for some sound effects. 

Really quickly I whipped up a model. I wanted to stay low polly hopfully achiving the nostalgic and cute register.

*Innicialy I exported it with material files link but fixed that up later. 

As you can see, in the blender viewport there was no conections between the frames back legs but there was some sort of error when I viewed it in p5 and on my desktop. I didn't bother fixing this up, I though aslong as the normals pointed in the right direction textureing would function fine and it sort of looks intentional üßê

<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Loading models and working out orbitcControle</h2>

Next I started loading the models into my sketch. I immidiatly realised it would take a few lines that hoepfuly I could optimise later but for now they were just going to have to take up the space.

Then when I called the model(variable name) syntax I noticed the models didn't show up. I assumed this was becuause the scale was off so I looked into the p5 resources page which explained I could use a second perameter and dictate "true" to normalise the model scale. Then all I needed to do was push() and pop() each model instance to scale and translate them to model the bike. I could have exported one model but then I coulsn't textue differant parts differant colours or spin the wheels.

Another annoying feature was seeing all the edges of the model. Dispite being low-poly there were plenty of edges that were very distracting but I assumed that setting noStroke() would remove the edges, whitch it did. 

To rotate and zoom the model I used the orbitControle() syntax but quickly realised if I added any squares abd text for UI later that would also be efected. If I push()'ed the orbitControle into a scope that only the bike was in it meant the velocity of the bike didn't remain.

^you can also notice at this point I was using double clicks to change the size of the canvas, with the idea of moveing the bike down and showing the ui that was off screen. Although the rotation point was still the center of the screen meaning the UI would cover the model in some positions.

<h3 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Solution</h3>

I did a bunch of tests and research into how to manually rotate the model. In the end mouseDrag function helped create the interactivity and I used a function to store and decrement the velosity of the model to simulate air resistance.

The most useful resources were from codeing train videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TPVoB4uQCU" target="_blank">18.2</a> + <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW3D9WwalQE" target="_blank">18.5</a> and the <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/rotateX/" target="_blank">p5 resource library</a> 

<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">UI</h2>

Next I wanted to get an idea of what UI elements I might needü§î I headed to Figma to mock up a super simple vertion of my idea.

<a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/ZKlKPdINwOHSP3Z5YdM52G/CSS_Assignment1?node-id=0-1&t=XwW1yqLRu4P6cR95-1" target="_blank">Use this to see the prototype view without signing in</a>

This was really helpful to translate what I was thinking to how it might look.

To implement this into my p5 sketch I created rectangles that had the variable "ui" in the x potition meaning I could increase the value when the ui was active bringing each element onto canvas and revert it easily.

Making it smooth on the other hand was much trickier. 
I tryed all sorts of methods of for loops that increment the value to a certain point but I found that it would snap the UI open every time. I turned to old faithful chatGPT.

This produced exactly what I needed but with new syntax???üßê

This lead me into a rabbit hole of discovery about abs and the ternery opperatior. I found abs(probably short of absolute) on the p5 resources and worked out it finds the distance from 0 so essencialy returns negitive numbers as positive, in this case allows the target to work when going back and forth and helps more accuratly snap. Unfortunetly p5 resources and the coding train had nothing on the "? :" but I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=ib8MHSMwtYg&t=13s" target="_blank">this video</a> had fun examples and taught me what the turnery opperator was.

I tried not to blatantly rip the code but much of the functionality is the same. I used this again later to move the toggle button smoothly.  

I think what I wasn't getting was the need to multiply the value by 0.1 or a small fraction to slow the growth and I had no plans to add the snapping feature but it if really helpful. The ternery isn't **really** neccecery but its fun to use and it shortens the code.

Right after implimenting it I wrote some code that checked for mouse position on tab to open and close the UI.

This is how we got to the mockup from last week.

<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Sounds and bike interactivity</h2>

At this point I was getting to the pointy end of the assingment

<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Feedback</h2>

<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Finish</h2>

<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Issues</h2>

<h2 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Successes</h2>

## Issues
- load optimisation
- textures 
- *models mtl
- scale canvas
- hitbox
- including boolean
- drawing posiiton was centered rathan than the top left in WEBGL

## Successes
- Found coding train an amazing resource (personaly)
- Successfuly translated visual ideas from figma to p5
- utilised modeling skills 
- Made a project that includes all the code criteria and (that I personaly think) looks, sounds, and acts cute
