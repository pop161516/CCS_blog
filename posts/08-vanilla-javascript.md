Today we covered a lot of theory. We started using JavaScript in Visual Studio code and making a canvas in the DOM. 

We went over the 'Anatomy of a website' talking about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Next we discussed effective complexity again, the push and pull between structure and randomðŸ¤¯

<h1 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Homework</h1>
explore high compressibility, low compressibility, and high effective complexity in p5!!

(the bottom two are interactive(kind of))

Also in the homework there is a quote by Philip Galanter 

> " ... some maintain that this notion of structure is subjective and remains in the eye of the beholder. "

This may be relivent to generative art because it brings uniquness to art that an artist may not intend?

We talked about "intentional fallacy" in class (I'm not sure what week that was(could be in the futureðŸ¤«)) this idea that the audiance create the meaning means that generative art is as meaningful or useless as the audiance deems it. *Duchamp giggling in his grave*

In regards to my sketches if they were interperated by an audience with no sense of memory they might not be able to comprehend the low complexity sketch of a beeing with a far supiriour language structure might find a way of comunicating and replicating the complax sketch with ease meaning the complexity is subjective?

The artist [**Ted Davis** ](https://teddavis.org/#projects {:target="_blank"} ) uses effective complexity in their websites home page with iteration and glich like effects to create an unpredictable structured artwork. using geometric shape in an unpredictable way.
