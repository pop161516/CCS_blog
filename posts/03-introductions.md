## Summery
Todays class wasn't so work heavy either... we spent quite a while on the introductions which was fun🤩

My two truths and a lie were:
- I watched 250 movies last year 🎥
- I have 4 pet rats 🐀
- I have 46 first cousins 🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒

but quite a few people got me... damn

Then we broke off into groups and started thinking about aesthetic registers...
