Todays class wasn't so work heavy either... we spent quite a while on the introductions which was funü§©

My two truths and a lie were:
- I watched 250 movies last year üé•
- I have 4 pet rats üêÄ (ü§°the lie)
- I have 46 first cousins üßë‚Äçüßë‚Äçüßí‚Äçüßí

but quite a few people got me... damn

Then we broke off into groups and started thinking about aesthetic registers...

<h1 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Homework</h1>

The homework assignment was to discuss how to create cute *visuals, sounds, and interactions* as well as to begine planning my assignment 1.

<h4 style="color:CornflowerBlue;">Visuals:</h4>

- When I think of cute visuals I think... Big eyes, small/young, round and smooth shape/form. some examples:

- For sounds I think high piched, babyish and animal sounds make for a cute aesthetic.
